In this blog, I will try to learn some scss and style the site in a way that is not horrible.

In my real life, I am actually a web developer. However, I have always worked for corporate back offices. The
job really is not bad. I like my work. However, as a result of the frameworks I use and just the needs of companies
being more on the functional side than on the styles side, I have never learned how to really style stuff.

The tec I have spent the most time with is [angular](https://angular.io/). Its not as popular as [react](https://react.dev/)
but it has severed me well and I believe it is easier to get into than React.

In angular, (and other js frameworks) most devs will use a component library. These are free or payed pre made stuff
that you can put on your site. They save a **LOT** of time. They also usually have a bunch of cool styles built
right in and work out of the box. However, using them comes at a cost, they abstract away the core tec that they use under the hood. When I first started working, I knew very little about html and css. Html is actually pretty easy and I picked it
up pretty quick. However, css is something that I believe most people would say is very confusing. At least at first.
I was also not helped in the fact that all the other developers that I worked with where also pretty bad at css. They knew
about the different html elements, but their advice on how to style a site was not great.

In time I grew to dislike css. I leaned into the default styles of the component libraries I used. I learned how to style 
these specific components instead of how to style basic elements. If you are just going to be using js frameworks and component libraries, I believe that you can go very far with just that knowledge and maybe knowing about flex box to
layout your components. The problem comes when you try to do anything *without* these tools.

As you can see, the site this text is on is rather bare. I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/). No theme, no css framework. Just a static site generator to save some time (and also cause I have an interest in the [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/)), and Scss because it is built into Angular and can also help save some
time. The site is bare because I don't really know how to make it look much better. Or even what I want it to look like.
I hope that by working on this site, I can learn some new tricks and be a better developer in the process.
