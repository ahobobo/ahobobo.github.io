title: The WebStrike Outage
---

Today has started in a rather interesting way. I tend to wake up and work out a little in the morning. After
that I look on youtube to try and fill up my watch later with stuff to listen to while I work. On the youtube
front page, I saw new stories covering some major tec outage that was ongoing. I did not think to much of it
since I had not been affected by it yet, but low and behold, I would be hearing about it again later on that
day.

Later that day I would discover that airplanes could not land, and stores could not do business. This outage
may not have affected me all that much, but it certainly was affecting a whole lot of other people.

An interesting part of modern life is the great levels of efficiency and interconnectedness that the world has
achieved. Computers are kept up to date on their own and only require occasional oversight to perform their
jobs. However, this comes at a price.

One bad update gets through, and now many many computers are no longer functional. The people that depend on
these computers are affected and things can grind to a halt. It's an unfortunate thing but it happens.

The take away here is that its always good to have a back up. Things work most of the time, and not everything
needs to be super resilient. It would be a waste to do so. However certain things, like the computers needed to
land planes, should likely have fail safes on them to ensure that even if they go down for a moment, they can
be brought back. Lest they go down and people are stuck flying in circles unable to land.
